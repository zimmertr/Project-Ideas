# Project Ideas

## Summary

This repository is simply a collection of project ideas that I have. 

## Software

1. Create a Linux tool with a graphical front end for remapping mouse buttons. It's way too complicated to do by hand and would be a good learning experience for GTK/QT. 

## Hardware

1. Create a project to monitor my networking  status with a programmable microcomputer. 
```
    - LED lights to monitor status of internet connectivity, internal DNS, external DNS, wireless network, etc. Blink lights if in warning state.
    - Speaker to beep periodically as an `alarm` when warnining states occur.
    - 8-segment screens and a button to switch through status for ping response times, download speed, upload speed, etc.
```
